# Mixed-Effect-Logistic-Model-In-Python
A test to run mixed effect logistic regression in python using tensorflow and edward

I came across this problem at work, and did some research on the topic. It's possible to do this with pymer4, but using tensorflow and edward also seems to be a nice approach. Wanted to upload my test here just as a practice for myself.

So far I have only implemented logistic model without mixed effect, will update the mixed effect part when I get a chance.
