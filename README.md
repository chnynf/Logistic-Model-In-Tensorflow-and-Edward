# Logistic-Model-In-Tensorflow-and-Edward
A test to run logistic regression in python using tensorflow and edward

I came across this problem at work where I need to run mixed effect logistic regressions in python. I did some research on the topic and found that it's possible with pymer4, but using tensorflow and edward also seems to be a nice approach. Wanted to upload my test here just as a practice. So far I have only implemented logistic model without mixed effect, will update the mixed effect part when I get a chance.
